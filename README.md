## Usage

This app is used to take in information into a table base and sort it into 3 different tables, departments, roles, and employees. When you pull up your command line you will run npm start which will prompt you with a question that asks what you would like to do? You then choose from a list of answers which will then prompt a series of questions depending upon your choice. These questions will either show information in one of the 3 tables, create a new entry into on of the tables, or update entry in a table. Below is a video walk through of how to use the application.
